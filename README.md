# Predicting Monthly Residential Electricity Consumption 

Using the United States Energy Information Administration's 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) dataset, CRISP-DM data mining methodologies are used to better understand the housing features, characteristics, socio-economics, socio-demographics, appliance presence, age and usage frequencies that contribute to an American household's monthly KWh consumption. 

# Overview
